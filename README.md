# My attemt at creating a FOSS strategical game

### If you somehow stumbeled across this project. 

It is just a side project, so don't expect anything majestic.


### What I plan to do

- [ ] A strategical game with focus on planning ahead of time
- [ ] Hexagonal grid map
- [ ] Map creation using wave function collapse, so custom maps are supported
- [ ] Multiplayer (if I manage to do it)
